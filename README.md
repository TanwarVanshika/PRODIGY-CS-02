Encryption: The encrypt_image function reads the image, converts it to a NumPy array, and applies a basic mathematical operation (adding a key value) to each pixel. The result is saved as an encrypted image.
Decryption: The decrypt_image function reverses the encryption process by subtracting the key value from each pixel.
User Interaction: The main function allows users to choose between encryption and decryption, input the image path, output path, and key, and perform the desired operation.
